A Selection for the Picture Book Shelf,1964-05-10,article,Archives,Archives,[],,The New York Times,"AS the twilight hours stretch into the long, lovely evenings of summer there will be more stay ‐ up time for the youngest members — those of picture‐book age—in the family. MIRANDA'S BEAUTIFUL DREAM (Harper & Row, $1.95) by Robert Kraus, should send little girls off to sleep with a smile almost as ecstatic as that of the kitten in this slight tale. Mr. Kraus's dream of a world. at peace is depicted in lacy designs of pale blue and gold, with just enough light humor to keep it from tasting of treacle. Alvin Tresselt's HOW FAR IS FAR? (Parents' Magazine Press, $2.75), poses the kind of question a youngster might ask as he watches the summer sky grow dim. The answers, given by an off‐beat grandmother, two parents and various animals, are imaginative and poetic rather than scientific—and quite uneven in quality. Illustrator Ward Brackett, using a highly individualistic version of collage, achieves varied and subtle results throughout, with several pages of striking beauty. Nature's mysteries are also plumbed in Ann McGovern's WHO HAS A SECRET? (Houghton Mifflin, $3.25). Here the text is extremely simple and repetitive, fine for the youngest reader but requiring a good deal of explanation. Nola Langner's representation of animal life—below the soil, in a pond, deep inside a forest — has great charm, more so than her children, whose eyes seem strangely haunted."

Gulag in the Mind of a Dog,1979-07-15,article,Archives,Archives,['BOOK REVIEWS'],"Vladimov, Georgi: Faithful Ruslan reviewed by Paul Zweig",The New York Times,"GEORGI VLADIMOV is a Soviet writer who remains virtually unpublished in his own country. Until this novel appeared in an émigré magazine in Germany in 1975, he had done virtually all his writing for the “desk drawer,” as the Russians say. To write without an audience must surely be a FAITHFUL HUSLIIN By Georgi Vladimov. Translated by Michael Glenny. 220 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $9.95. writer's idea of hell, yet generations of Soviet writers have drawn a kind of strength from it. This hell has bred a tradition of fierce humanism and hard selfreliance, which treats the act of writing not only as an act of moral survival but also as a form of testimony. The “desk‐drawer” writer writes with his life, as Mr. Vladimov made clear two years ago in his scathing letter of resignation to the Soviet Writers Union. “Faithful Ruslan” is the story of a guard dog at a Siberian prison camp. It begins in that ambiguous dawn of the mid‐1950's, when, on Nikita Khrushchev's order, the camps were being emptied of their countless thousands of prisoners. The book opens in the silence of the empty camp, the prisoners gone, the gates swung ominously open. Ruslan is bewildered, afraid he has “stopped understanding,” which is dogtalk for a senile spooking of the mind, leading inexorably to a bullet in the head. For the camp code is all that Ruslan has ever known, having been trained for it by the ingenious cruelty of his masters. To him, the prisoners are shabby, half‐starved creatures, capable of unspeakable betrayal. The masters, with their “god‐like” eyes and automatic rifles, punish unerringly, but also caress and give food. From them Ruslan has learned the “bliss” of obedience. He knows that to obey is to belong to the gods, whom he loves."

Last June, a dog named Solo, working for the Monmouth County Sheriff's Department, was killed by gunshot in a standoff with a robbery suspect in Asbury Park. So upset was Roseann Trezza, the assistant director of the Associated Humane Societies, that she began a drive to provide bulletproof vests for all the state's police dogs, all through donated money. Last month, Vested Interest, as her fund is called, presented 47 vests to dogs, and last week, an order went out for 21 more. Ms. Trezza priced vists at as much as $1,700 apiece but found a company that would see them to her for $300. That is a small investment, she points out, in an animal that often costs $5,000 to buy and thousands more to train. She has received a number of letters from police officers thanking her and reporting that the dogs moved easily and seemed comfortable wearing the vests.

He was always clean and professionally groomed in what I now know is called a sporting trim, with a scissored cap of hair on his head and a pompon on his tail. He was adventurous and liked to lead me out on innocent missions just beyond the yard of my parents' summer house. I must have been too well dressed (I was a first child) in clever, jaunty little outfits, with matching knit sweaters, as I was summarily rejected from the juvenile community. But Chippie didn't seem to care about my clothes and was content to play within the confines of our property. One day he was abducted and murdered by the neighborhood bully, a flat-faced boxer who liked to chew tennis balls and, apparently, poodles. The man who owned the boxer returned Chippie in a shoe box and asked that we spare his dog as perhaps our poodle was simply too irresistible. We buried Chippie. It was the first I'd heard of heaven, and I was glad poodles were welcome there. But thereafter my mother was careful to find more neutral clothes for me to wear, and I never allowed myself to consider walking down the street with a poodle again, though I have owned and shown many of them since."

If that’s true, the dog is unlikely to come from a pound, but could come from the breed rescue group. PWDs are not abundant, and the club is highly active and protective–it’s been a leader in genetic research, due to a plant geneticist in Utah, Karl Gordon Lark, who decided to find out why his beloved PWD died young. If not a rescue, and there are plenty of reasons not to go that route, even if a dog were available, then it will come from a breeder–that’s my bet–and the animal welfare groups will howl. Not a thing new about that. They have to howl about something. I say let the Obamas have the dog of their choosing. Anyway, those are guesses. I have no insider knowledge on this one. We’ll see."

The dog has long been a fixture in the tabloids and local news for the inevitable attacks that result from their corrupted rearing. But perhaps underscoring how debased the beast has become is the latest outcry for its banishment, spawned by the misdeed of another breed entirely, the Rottweiler, one of whose kind mauled a 3-year-old boy in the Bronx in October. (The dog's owner, it turned out, was a former convict and parole violator.) The incident sparked the by-now familiar and sadly hollow outcry to ban ''bad breeds,'' as one local tabloid referred to them. In some cities, certain breeds can be singled out as dangerous and required to wear muzzles. Many municipalities across the U.S. have banned pit bulls outright, Denver, Miami-Dade County and Cincinnati among them. And now a number of New York State lawmakers are pushing to overturn a current state law that prohibits cities and towns from banning specific dogs. In a single stroke, this course of action makes the dog the scapegoat for the true culprits while also ensuring that it remains, precisely because of its ''outlaw'' status, the breed of choice for inner-city wannabe hoods and backwoods anarchists alike.

In order to increase the chances that they would receive proper burials, soldiers bought customized name tags made of metal or wood.

How to Train a Cadaver Dog,2015-06-19,article,News,Magazine,"['Dogs', 'Death and Dying', 'Smells and Odors', 'Cadavers']",Find an incurious animal.

Cablk, a scientist at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada who studies scent detection. Training a cadaver dog requires regular contact with human blood, decaying flesh and bones. In the United States, dog handlers can legally obtain bodily components like human placenta and blood, but not always easily, and trainers like Cablk often resort to using their own blood. Some substitute commercially available ersatz odors (the most common is Sigma Pseudo Corpse Scent, which comes in three kinds: recently dead, decomposed and drowned). But deceased humans produce unique volatile organic compounds, and canines have a keenly attuned sense of smell, so you should practice on the real thing. “You don’t want to put other people at risk,” Cablk says — searches are often in dangerous areas, like collapsed buildings — “to find what is ultimately a dead pet.”"
