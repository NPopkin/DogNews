## Dog News Project
This project looked at 2,000 news articles from th NYt and analyzed what type of language was used in these articles using basic visualization techniques along with NLP tools such as Word2Vec and topic modeling. Generally, most of the articles published dispurpotionalty were about dog shows and in the future it would be interesting to diversify and increase the data used.


## NYT Data
The first step in this project was using the NYT API to collect around 2,000 articles from the last 60 years. The key features for this data were the headlines, date published and the first paragraph of the article. This code to extract the data available here: [nyt_data.py](https://github.com/NPopkin/DogNews/blob/master/nyt_data.py).
You can also look at the csv file here: [nyt_1950_2020.csv](https://github.com/NPopkin/DogNews/blob/master/nyt_1950_2020.csv)
